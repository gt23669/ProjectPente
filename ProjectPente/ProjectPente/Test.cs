         objective:
            place 5 or more objects in a line. Horizontal, vertical, diagonal.
            capture 5 or more pairs of objects
        HTP:    
            start with empty board
            player 1(black) places objects on center spot
            players then take turns placing objects
            objects are placed on line intersections including the edge of the board
            objects can not move around once placed aside from capture
            continue adding objects to the board until one person wins
        Capture:
            Whenever your opponent has two objects (and only two) which are adjacent, they are up for capture. bracket their objects with your own to capture those two objects. Captured objects are removed from the board
        WTG:
            One player captures 5 pairs
            one player lines 5 objects in a row
            opponent has no "last chance"
        TOURNAMENT RULES:
            first player's first move must be on the center point. the first player's second move is restricted to playing three or more intersections away from the center of the board. All other rules of standard Pente apply.
